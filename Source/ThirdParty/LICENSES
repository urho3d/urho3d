SLA with immediate effect. However, should Licensee institute, or
threaten to institute, patent litigation against any other licensee of
the Software based on such other licensee's use of any other software

terminate this SLA.

This SLA does not transfer to Licensee any ownership to any Ericsson
or third party intellectual property rights. All rights not expressly
granted by Ericsson under this SLA are hereby expressly
reserved. Furthermore, nothing in this SLA shall be construed as a
right to use or sell products in a manner which conveys or purports to
convey whether explicitly, by principles of implied license, or
otherwise, any rights to any third party, under any patent of Ericsson
or of Ericsson's affiliates covering or relating to any combination of
the Software with any other software or product (not licensed
hereunder) where the right applies specifically to the combination and
not to the software or product itself.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS". ERICSSON MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OF
ANY KIND, EXTENDS NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY; INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,

REPAIR OR CORRECTION. ERICSSON MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE MANUFACTURE,
SALE, OFFERING FOR SALE, DISTRIBUTION, LEASE, USE OR IMPORTATION UNDER

LICENSE AND THE SLA ARE SUBJECT TO LICENSEE'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO
MAKE SUCH DETERMINATION AND ACQUIRE SUCH LICENSES AS MAY BE NECESSARY
WITH RESPECT TO PATENTS, COPYRIGHT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF
THIRD PARTIES.

THE LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND ACCEPTS THAT THE SOFTWARE (I) IS NOT

LIMITED TO OPERATION OF NUCLEAR OR HEALTHCARE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND/OR

FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THIS PARAGRAPH.

IN NO EVENT SHALL ERICSSON BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PERSONAL INJURY, ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERUPTIONS, OR ANY
OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THE LICENSEE OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER

omission by Ericsson to exercise any right or power shall impair any
such right or power to be construed to be a waiver thereof. Consent by
Ericsson to, or waiver of, a breach by the Licensee shall not
constitute consent to, waiver of, or excuse for any other different or
subsequent breach.

dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with
this SLA, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be
