	/// The last value of each variable will be saved per remote system. Additionally, a history of \a _sendReceipts is stored to determine what to resend on packetloss.
	/// When variables are lost, they will be flagged dirty and always resent to the system that lost it
	/// Disadvantages: Every variable for every remote system is copied internally, in addition to a history list of what variables changed for which \a _sendReceipt. Very memory and CPU intensive for multiple connections.
	/// Advantages: When data needs to be resent by RakNet, RakNet can only resend the value it currently has. This allows the application to control the resend, sending the most recent value of the variable. The end result is that bandwidth is used more efficiently because old data is never sent.
