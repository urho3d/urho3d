/// \brief Encapsulates UDT congestion control, as used by RakNet
/// Requirements:
/// <OL>
/// <LI>Each datagram is no more than MAXIMUM_MTU_SIZE, after accounting for the UDP header
/// <LI>Each datagram containing a user message has a sequence number which is set after calling OnSendBytes(). Set it by calling GetAndIncrementNextDatagramSequenceNumber()
/// <LI>System is designed to be used from a single thread.
/// <LI>Each packet should have a timeout time based on GetSenderRTOForACK(). If this time elapses, add the packet to the head of the send list for retransmission.
/// </OL>
///
/// Recommended:
/// <OL>
/// <LI>Call sendto in its own thread. This takes a significant amount of time in high speed networks.
/// </OL>
///
/// Algorithm:
/// <OL>
/// <LI>On a new connection, call Init()
/// <LI>On a periodic interval (SYN time is the best) call Update(). Also call ShouldSendACKs(), and send buffered ACKS if it returns true.
/// <LI>Call OnSendAck() when sending acks.
/// <LI>When you want to send or resend data, call GetNumberOfBytesToSend(). It will return you enough bytes to keep you busy for \a estimatedTimeToNextTick. You can send more than this to fill out a datagram, or to send packet pairs
/// <LI>Call OnSendBytes() when sending datagrams.
/// <LI>When data arrives, record the sequence number and buffer an ACK for it, to be sent from Update() if ShouldSendACKs() returns true
/// <LI>Every 16 packets that you send, send two of them back to back (a packet pair) as long as both packets are the same size. If you don't have two packets the same size, it is fine to defer this until you do.
/// <LI>When you get a packet, call OnGotPacket(). If the packet is also either of a packet pair, call OnGotPacketPair()
/// <LI>If you get a packet, and the sequence number is not 1 + the last sequence number, send a NAK. On the remote system, call OnNAK() and resend that message.
/// <LI>If you get an ACK, remove that message from retransmission. Call OnNonDuplicateAck().
/// <LI>If a message is not ACKed for GetRTOForRetransmission(), resend it.
/// </OL>
