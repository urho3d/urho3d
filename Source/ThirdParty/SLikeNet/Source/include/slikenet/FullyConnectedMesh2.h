	/// In the simple case of forming a peer to peer mesh:
	///
	/// 1. AddParticipant() is called on the host whenever you get a new connection
	/// 2. The host sends all participants to the new client
	/// 3. The client connects to the participant list
	///
	/// However, the above steps assumes connections to all systems in the mesh always complete.
	/// When there is a risk of failure, such as if relying on NATPunchthroughClient, you may not want to call AddParticipant() until are connections have completed to all other particpants
	/// StartVerifiedJoin() can manage the overhead of the negotiation involved so the programmer only has to deal with overall success or failure
	///
	/// Processing:
	/// 1. Send the RakNetGUID and SystemAddress values of GetParticipantList() to the client with ID_FCM2_VERIFIED_JOIN_START
	/// 2. The client, on ID_FCM2_VERIFIED_JOIN_START, can execute NatPunchthroughClient::OpenNAT() (optional), followed by RakPeerInterface::Connect() if punchthrough success, for each system returned from GetVerifiedJoinRequiredProcessingList()
	/// 3. After all participants in step 2 have connected, failed to connect, or failed NatPunchthrough, the client automatically sends the results to the server.
	/// 4. The server compares the results of the operations in step 2 with the values from GetParticpantList().
	/// 4A. If the client failed to connect to a current participant, return ID_FCM2_VERIFIED_JOIN_FAILED to the client. CloseConnection() is automatically called on the client for the failed participants.
	/// 4B. If AddParticipant() was called between steps 1 and 4, go back to step 1, transmitting new participants.
	/// 4C. If the client successfully connected to all participants, the server gets ID_FCM2_VERIFIED_JOIN_CAPABLE. The server programmer, on the same frame, should execute RespondOnVerifiedJoinCapable() to either accept or reject the client.
	/// 5. If the client got ID_FCM2_VERIFIED_JOIN_ACCEPTED, AddParticipant() is automatically called for each system in the mesh.
	/// 6. If the client got ID_FCM2_VERIFIED_JOIN_REJECTED, CloseConnection() is automatically called for each system in the mesh. The connection is NOT automatically closed to the original host that sent StartVerifiedJoin().
	/// 7. If the client's connection to the server was lost before getting ID_FCM2_VERIFIED_JOIN_ACCEPTED or ID_FCM2_VERIFIED_JOIN_REJECTED, return to the programmer ID_FCM2_VERIFIED_JOIN_FAILED and call RakPeerInterface::CloseConnection()
