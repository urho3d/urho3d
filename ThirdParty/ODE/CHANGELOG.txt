08/11/09 Daniel K. O.
        * Made sure neither dSINGLE or dDOUBLE is defined by default; the user
          should always explicitly specify the precision.

06/27/09 Oleh Derevenko
        * New functions have been added:
           - dWorldUseSharedWorkingMemory
           - dWorldCleanupWorkingMemory
           - dWorldSetStepMemoryReservationPolicy
           - dWorldSetStepMemoryManager
		
06/25/09 Remi Ricard (papaDoc)

         for the pu joint.

06/14/09 Oleh Derevenko
		* dWorldQuickStep re-implemented to avoid memory allocation on stack.
		  Also several optimizations have been made to decrease memory 
		  requirements and optimize algorithm implementation of dWorldQuickStep.
		  dWorldStep still remains with old memory allocation however new APIs
		  mentioned below are fully functional for it.
		  Both dWorldStep and dWorldQuickStep have been changed to return boolean
		  success status.

		* dInitODE2() changed to automatically call 
		  AllocateODEDataForThread(dAllocateFlagBasicData) after library 
		  initialization as this is a required initialization minimum that
		  must always be performed anyway.

06/05/09 Daniel K. O.
         * Removed aliasing issues from OPCODE/Ice, plus some other warnings.
           Now it builds on gcc 4.3.2 with '-Wall -Werror -O3".

          MIN/MAX heights.

05/03/09 Oleh Derevenko
        * Incorrect parameter order fixed on contact merging in Sphere-Trimesh
          collisions. The bug resulted in merged contact remaining with normal
          of first contact found. Thanks to Dimitris Papavasiliou for reporting.

04/23/09 Daniel K. O.
        * Fixed bug #2685170: use the C99 __func__ instead of __FUNCTION__ when

03/14/09 Oleh Derevenko
        * A possibility to initialize/close ODE multiple times recursively has 
          been added.
          Also, now a call to dSpaceSetManualCleanup() is required for each 
          space right after creation if ODE has been initialized in thread data
          manual cleanup mode.
           
03/07/09 Oleh Derevenko
        * Thread local data has been cleaned up from OPCODE and OdeTls as it is
          not used (OPC_SweepAndPrune.* and OPC_BoxPruning.* have been removed
          - rebuilding project files is necessary).

        * New house of cards demo, which stresses the friction handling stability.

01/29/09 Remi Ricard (papaDoc)

           limit of limot1 to zero and not limot2

01/17/09 Daniel K. O.
        * Fixed a bug in dSpaceCollide2: if both geoms are not in spaces they would
          not have valid AABBs.

12/20/08 Daniel K. O.
        * New functions: dJointEnable, dJointDisable, dJointIsEnabled
          (patch #2454764).

12/06/08 Oleh Derevenko

       * Applied a patch by Martijn Buijs to make GIMPACT trimesh-ray collisions to
         be consistent with those in OPCODE.
       * Swapped geometries returned in contacts for OPCODE Trimesh-Plane collisions
         as they were returned in unnatural order being different from that in GIMPACT
       * Applied a patch by Martijn Buijs to make side1, side2 fields of contact 
         structure be always initialized, either with -1 for non-trmesh geometries
         or with triangle index for trimeshes. These fields were only assigned for
         trimesh-trimesh collisions before.
       * dGeomTriMeshSetTriMergeCallback/dGeomTriMeshGetTriMergeCallback API added
         to set/get user defined callback procedure for trimeshes that would be 
         invoked when contacts are merged to let user code accumulate attributes of
         original contact triangles and generate a fake index by which it would 
         later be able to determine those attributes. If the callback is not 
         assigned (the default) -1 is generated as triangle index for merged 
         contacts (there was an index of first of merged triangles before!!!).
         The callback is currently used within OPCODE trimesh-sphere and OPCODE
         new trimesh-trimesh collisions.

11/20/08 Remi Ricard (papaDoc)
       * Fix problem with dJointGetPUPosition and
         dJointGetPUPositionRate when the joint is attached to only

         dJointAttach(jId, 0, bId). The body was not push in the right direction to
         move back between the limits.
       * Add unit test to check the above problem
       * Add the function void dJointSetPUAnchorOffset

10/26/05 rodrigo

	* Removed LIBTOOL from autotools since it was not really required.
	* Added a target to build ODE as a shared library, this shared
	  library gets build alongside the static one, no flags required.

10/24/05 tfautre

	(Backported patches from STABLE branch, applied by Adam)

	  added support for preprocessed info to the ccylinder-trimesh
	  collider.

12/07/04 adam

        * Important AMotors bugfix

09/22/04 jeff

	* Assorted small bugfixes and tweaks for
	  trimesh_{box,ccylinder,trimesh} collisions

09/21/04 jeff

	* added functions to joint.cpp to allow joint attachment to moving
	  geoms.

	* added malloc-based memory allocation in step.cpp & lcp.cpp (turned
	  on with a #define switch in common.h)
	
05/29/04 russ

	* added joint feedback to the QuickStep solver

05/18/04 russ

	* added warm starting to the QuickStep solver

05/18/04 russ

	* added the QuickStep solver
	
	* added contact parameter functions.

05/05/04 adam

        * use dRandInt instead of rand() in stepfast.

04/21/04 russ

	* added auto-disable support from Aras Pranckevicius (with
	  modifications by russ). this useful feature can speed up
	  simulation significantly in some cases.
	
	* various internal tidyups.

04/20/04 russ

	* changed the meaning of the 'index' argument to dJointGetBody():
	  it was the only remaining API function that does not respect
	  dJOINT_REVERSE (spotted by Matthew D. Hancher).
	
	* updated the C++ headers: fixed two minor bugs and added
	  support for dQuadTreeSpace, dRay, and the dGeom::getSpace() method
	  (from Matthew D. Hancher).

04/18/04 russ

	* changed the way that the dInfinity constant is implemented: now it
	  is #defined to be one of: FLT_MAX, DBL_MAX, HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, or
	  a large numeric constant. previously it was a variable that was
	  exported from the library. this simplifies the configuration and
	  build process quite a bit, especially in the case of DLLs.
	
	* removed the old, deprecated collision system (geom.cpp,space.cpp,
	  geom.h,space.h,odecpp_old_collision.h). the ODE_OLD_COLLISION
	  configuration setting no longer has any meaning.
	
	* removed support for dGeomGroups, which have been deprecated for
	  a while and are equivalent to 'spaces' anyway.

04/13/04 russ

	* bug fix in dMassSetCappedCylinder(), from Matthew D. Hancher.

04/08/04 russ

	* added trimesh-CCylinder capability, from Vadim Macagon
	  <vadim_mcagon@hotmail.com>.

04/04/04 adam

        * yet another rewrite of triangle-box collision code, this
        time based on code donated by Croteam, ported by asko@jetti.org
        and tweaked by Erwin.

04/04/04 adam

        * merged trimesh-trimesh collision code by
        Jeffrey Smith <jeffreys@Softimage.com>.

        * changed it to not break the trimesh interface, fix
        some GCC compilation problems, bring it up to date with
        ODE changes from 2003-11-15 -> 2004-04-04.

        * add ability to drop meshes on meshes in test_moving_trimesh,
        not as good as it could be but it's illustrative.

01/16/04 adam

	* implement a bunch of ultra-simple TriMesh functions that were
	in the headers but not in the code -- patch by
	Vadim Macagon <vadim_mcagon@hotmail.com>

	* disable temporal coherence on trimeshes by default, since
	it has scaleability issues that don't make it a general clear win.

12/01/03 adam

	* implement dxHashSpace::collide2(), not particularly efficiently.

11/14/03 adam

	* applied several Trimesh fixes and improvements from
	Aras Pranckevicius <nearaz@interamotion.com>

10/22/03 adam

	* apply Nguyen Binh's work for removing many dSetZero() calls
	and some other extraneous initializations.

	* added joint limits and motors to universal joints.

	* reversed the polarity of the dJOINT_REVERSE flag.

06/30/03 russ

	* added the TriMesh geom class and the quad tree space to the ODE
	  core. both of these were developed by Erwin de Vries. added OPCODE
	  to the ODE distribution, this is required by TriMesh.

06/23/03 martin

	* added dGeomSetQuaternion() and dGeomGetQuaternion()
	
	* added dJointGet*Anchor2()

05/07/03 russ

11/24/02 russ

	* added support for multiple box-box contacts.

11/10/02 russ

	* added new collision system. select between the old/new system by
	  setting the ODE_OLD_COLLISION variable in config/user-settings.

10/28/02 russ

	* fixed two problems in the LCP code to improve the reliability of
	  the dContactApprox1 contact mode.

	* added a FAQ question about rolling bodies getting stuck when they
	  hit multiple geoms.

09/08/02 russ

	* added dClosestLineSegmentPoints().
	* implemented dCollideCB().

08/28/02 russ

	* added dJointSetFeedback() and dJointGetFeedback().

08/05/02 russ

	* added dGeomTransformSetInfo() and dGeomTransformGetInfo().

07/13/02 russ

	* added dBodySetForce(), dBodySetTorque(), dWorldImpulseToForce(),
	  dBodyGetPosRelPoint(), dBodyGetPosRelPoint(), dBodyVectorToWorld(),
	  dBodyVectorFromWorld().

	* added dBodyGetPointVel() (thanks to Colin Reed).

	* added a new C++ interface (from Martin C. Martin, with modifications
	  by russ). the old C++ interface is now in odecpp_old.h.

06/25/02 russ

	* added an additional BSD-style licensing option for ODE.

06/23/02 russ

	* added dCloseODE(), contributed by Nate Waddoups and David McClurg.

05/16/02 russ

	* added dSpaceQuery(), contributed by Nate Waddoups.

04/07/02 russ

	* added a section to the documentation for universal joints.
	  this includes a picture of the joint.

04/05/02 russ

	* added a universal joint class (generously contributed by
	  Martin C. Martin). it doesn't (yet) have a motor or joint limits,
	  but it does come with tests.

03/11/02 russ

	* makefile changes to accomodate OSs with command line length
	  limitations (thanks to Norman Lin).

01/06/02 russ

	* added the dBodySetGravityMode() and dBodyGetGravityMode()
	  functions, which change the dxBodyNoGravity body flag.

	* added support for building a DLL with MSVC - there is now a
	  msvc-dll target. thanks to Norman Lin for doing this.

12/28/01 russ

	* added the dParamCFM joint parameter.

12/24/01 russ

	* reworked the build system to make it more cross-platform.
	  there is now a single top-level makefile and a configurator.c
	  program. see the INSTALL file for details.

12/04/01 russ

	* the "angular motor" joint has been completed, and a new section
	  has been added to the documentation.

11/26/01 russ

	* added a new joint type: "angular motor". using this joint is a good
	  way to get ball-joint motors and limits. this is work in progress -
	  it has not been fully implemented or tested yet.

11/22/01 russ

	* replaced the mmap()-based joint group stack (stack.cpp) with a
	  malloc()-based arena stack (obstack.cpp). this will be more
	  portable and should not impact performance.

11/12/01 russ

	* changed the meaning of the 'flags' parameter to dCollide() and
	  related functions: now the size of the contact buffer is kept in
	  the lower 16 bits. this change will be backward compatible.

	* added dBodyGetFiniteRotationMode() and dBodyGetFiniteRotationAxis().

	* added dBodyAddForceAtRelPos() function.

11/11/01 russ

	* added the ability to manually enable and disable bodies.
	  see dBodyEnable(), dBodyDisable(), dBodyIsEnabled().

	* fixed a potential bug: when a world is destroyed that contains
	  joints in joint groups, those joints are marked as "deactivated" in
	  the joint group, so when the joint group is destroyed they can be
	  ignored.

	* the test_boxstack demo has new options to enable and disable bodies.

	* new configuration parameter in config.h: dEFFICIENT_SIZE.

11/11/01 russ

	* started the change log for ODE. changes older than today were added
	  to this file by inspecting the CVS logs.

11/05/01 russ

	* added REAL() constructions for floating point numbers, to prevent
	  many warnings when compiling under VC++.

11/03/01 russ

	* added geometry transform class, documented composite objects.

	* added collision rule: no contacts if both geoms on the same body.
	  this is not the best rule, may have to remove this in the future.

	* new dMassAdd() function.

	* capped cylinder to capped cylinder collision function.

10/31/01 russ

	* increase CFM in some demos to make them more robust.

10/29/01 russ

	* added new accessor functions.

10/19/01 russ

	* added the dJOINT_TWOBODIES flag to the joint, that says it can not
	  be attached to just one body.

10/12/01 russ

	* fixed a collision bug in dCollide() that was causing memory
	  corruption when multiple contacts were being returned.

10/11/01 russ

	* joints can now return m=0 to be "inactive". added a "null" joint
	  to test this.

10/09/01 russ

	* in the LCP solver, try to fail gracefully when s <= 0.

	* dAABBTestFn() API change.

10/08/01 russ

	* fixed a contact swapping bug in dCollide().

10/07/01 russ

	* added capped cylinder geometry object.

09/30/01 russ

	* the test_buggy demo now uses geometry groups.

	* added a dAABBTestFn field in the geometry classes.

09/29/01 russ

	* added geometry groups.

09/20/01 russ

	* added finite rotation stuff.
