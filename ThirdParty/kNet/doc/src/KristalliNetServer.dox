\section kNetServerSec Implementing a kNet Server

To write a server for kNet, proceed through the following steps:
<ol>
<li>#include "kNet.h". Make sure this #include is positioned before #include <windows.h>, or alternatively add a project-wide #define _WINSOCKAPI_. See \ref WS2Include.h "" for more details.</li>
<li>Instantiate a \ref kNet::Network "Network" object. Make sure this object stays alive for the duration that the server is running.</li>
<li>Define a class that implements the \ref kNet::INetworkServerListener "INetworkServerListener" interface. See the chapter \ref kNetServerListener "" for more details.</li>
<li>Start listening for inbound connections by calling \ref kNet::Network::StartServer "Network::StartServer". This method returns a newly created \ref kNet::NetworkServer "NetworkServer" object, which will be used to manage all server-related operations.</li>
<li>a) <b>Polled mode:</b> Perform processing in your main server loop, and periodically call \ref kNet::NetworkServer::ProcessMessages "NetworkServer::ProcessMessages" to manage new connection attempts and to receive new data from the client.
<br />
b) <b>Event mode:</b> Call \ref kNet::NetworkServer::RunModalServer "NetworkServer::RunModalServer" to have the server start its own event-based processing loop. It will notify about new connections through the listener object you registered when starting the server, until you shut down by calling \ref NetworkServer::StopModalServer "".</li>
</ol>

\section kNetServerListener The INetworkServerListener Methods

The \ref kNet::INetworkServerListener "INetworkServerListener" interface is a callback that needs to be implemented in order to receive notifications from a running \ref NetworkServer "". There are three events that are sent by the server. 

\note Do not call back to \ref kNet::NetworkServer::ProcessMessages "NetworkServer::ProcessMessages" from any of the member functions. This might cause an infinite recursion.  

\subsection KristalliServerNewAttempt A New Connection Attempt

The \ref kNet::INetworkServerListener::NewConnectionAttempt "INetworkServerListener::NewConnectionAttempt" method is invoked by the server when it operates in UDP mode and a ConnectSyn message is received from a new endpoint.

The implementation of this method should parse the byte data contained in this message, and decide whether the new connection attempt should be accepted. If so, the method should return <i>true</i>. If <i>false</i> is returned the connection datagram is discarded.

<span style="color: red;">The default implementation of this method is to accept all connection attempts</span>, so be sure to override this if you need to handle security.

If the server operates in TCP mode, this method will never be called.
 
\todo Describe non-stealth mode.

\subsection KristalliServerNewConnection A Successful Connection

The \ref kNet::INetworkServerListener::NewConnectionEstablished "INetworkServerListener::NewConnectionEstablished" method is invoked by the server when a new connection has successfully been established. This event is received in both TCP and UDP modes. 

<b>The implementation of this method should at least register a connection listener object to the new connection by calling</b> \ref kNet::MessageConnection::RegisterInboundMessageHandler "MessageConnection::RegisterInboundMessageHandler". The implementation may also perform any application-specific logic necessary in response to this event (i.e. send a custom message through the connection or notify other clients about the new connection).

The default implementation of this method does not do any processing. 

\subsection KristalliServerDisconnection A Client Quits

When a connection is shut down, either due to client or server disconnecting or because of the connection timing out, the \ref kNet::INetworkServerListener::ClientDisconnected "INetworkServerListener::ClientDisconnected" method is called. This event is received in both TCP and UDP modes. 

This method is only provided for the convenience of the developer. There are no required steps to perform in response for this event.

The default implementation is not to do anything. 

\section KristalliServerHelloExample A Server Application Example

<div>
<b> HelloServer.cpp:</b> An example server that says "hello" to clients. See \ref KristalliClientHelloExample "" for the matching client code.

\code

#include "kNet.h"

// Define a MessageID for our a custom message.
const message_id_t cHelloMessageID = 10;

// This object gets called for notifications on new network connection events.
class ServerListener : public INetworkServerListener
{
public:
   void NewConnectionEstablished(MessageConnection *connection)
   {
      // Start building a new message.
      NetworkMessage &msg = connection->StartNewMessage(cHelloMessageID);
      msg.reliable = true;
      
      // Create a DataSerializer object with a buffer of 256 bytes.
      DataSerializer ds(msg.data, 256);
      // Add a message string.
      ds.AddString(std::string("Hello! You are connecting from ") + connection->GetEndPoint().ToString());
      // Resize the buffer to the size we actually used.
      msg.data.resize(ds.BytesFilled());
      
      // Push the message out to the client.
      connection->EndAndQueueMessage(msg);
   }
};

int main()
{
   Network network;
   ServerListener listener;
   
   // Start listening on a port.
   const unsigned short cServerPort = 1234;
   NetworkServer *server = network.StartServer(cServerPort, SocketOverUDP, &listener);
   
   // Run the main server loop.
   // This never returns since we don't call NetworkServer::Stop(), but for this example, it doesn't matter.  
   server->RunModalServer();
}

\endcode
