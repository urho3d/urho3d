/// Team members contain properties including which teams they are on and which teams they want to join if a team is not immediately joinable
/// Advanced functionality includes the ability for a team member to be on multiple teams simultaneously, the ability to swap teams with other members, and the ability to resize the number of members supported per team

/// \brief Automates networking and list management for teams
/// \details TeamManager provides support for teams. A team is a list of team members.
/// Teams contain properties including the number of team members per team, whether or not tagged teams must have equal numbers of members, and if a team is locked or not to certain entry conditions
/// Team members contain properties including which teams they are on and which teams they want to join if a team is not immediately joinable
/// Advanced functionality includes the ability for a team member to be on multiple teams simultaneously, the ability to swap teams with other members, and the ability to resize the number of members supported per team
/// The architecture is designed for easy integration with ReplicaManager3 
///
/// Usage:<BR>
/// 1. Define your game classes to represent teams and team members. Your game classes should hold game-specific information such as team name and color.<BR>
/// 2. Have those game classes contain a corresponding TM_Team or TM_TeamMember instance. Operations on teams will be performed by those instances. Use SetOwner() to refer to the parent object when using composition.<BR>
/// 3. Call TeamManager::SetTopology() for client/server or peer to peer.<BR>
/// 4. Call AddWorld() to instantiate a TM_World object which will contain references to your TM_TeamMember and TM_Team instances.<BR>
/// 5. When you instantiate a TM_TeamMember or TM_Team object, call ReferenceTeam() and ReferenceTeamMember() for each corresponding object<BR>
/// 6. When sending world state to a new connection, for example in ReplicaManager3::SerializeConstruction(), call TM_SerializeConstruction() on the corresponding TM_TeamMember and TM_Team objects. TM_Team instances on the new connection must be created before TM_TeamMember instances.<BR>
/// 7. Call TM_DeserializeConstruction() on your new corresponding TM_TeamMember and TM_Team instances.<BR>
/// 8. Execute team operations. ID_TEAM_BALANCER_REQUESTED_TEAM_FULL, ID_TEAM_BALANCER_REQUESTED_TEAM_LOCKED, ID_TEAM_BALANCER_TEAM_REQUESTED_CANCELLED, and ID_TEAM_BALANCER_TEAM_ASSIGNED are returned to all systems when the corresponding event occurs for a team member.<BR>
/// 9. As the peer to peer session host changes, call SetHost() (Not necessary if using FullyConnectedMesh2). If using client/server, you must set the host<BR>
/// \note This replaces TeamBalancer. You cannot use TeamBalancer and TeamManager at the same time.
