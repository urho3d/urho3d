/**
 * @defgroup damping Damping
 * @ingroup bodies world
 *
 * Damping serves two purposes: reduce simulation instability, and to allow
 * the bodies to come to rest (and possibly auto-disabling them).
 *
 * Bodies are constructed using the world's current damping parameters. Setting
 * the scales to 0 disables the damping.
 *
 * Here is how it is done: after every time step linear and angular
 * velocities are tested against the corresponding thresholds. If they
 * are above, they are multiplied by (1 - scale). So a negative scale value
 * will actually increase the speed, and values greater than one will
 * make the object oscillate every step; both can make the simulation unstable.
 *
 * To disable damping just set the damping scale to zero.
 *
 * You can also limit the maximum angular velocity. In contrast to the damping
 * functions, the angular velocity is affected before the body is moved.
 * This means that it will introduce errors in joints that are forcing the body
 * to rotate too fast. Some bodies have naturally high angular velocities
 * (like cars' wheels), so you may want to give them a very high (like the default,
 * dInfinity) limit.
 *
 * @note The velocities are damped after the stepper function has moved the
 * object. Otherwise the damping could introduce errors in joints. First the
 * joint constraints are processed by the stepper (moving the body), then
 * the damping is applied.
 *
 * @note The damping happens right after the moved callback is called; this way 
 * it still possible use the exact velocities the body has acquired during the
 * step. You can even use the callback to create your own customized damping.

 *  @li Inertia matrix. This is a 3x3 matrix that describes how the body's mass
 *      is distributed around the center of mass. Conceptually each body has an
 *      x-y-z coordinate frame embedded in it that moves and rotates with the body.
 *
 * The origin of this coordinate frame is the body's point of reference. Some values
 * in ODE (vectors, matrices etc) are relative to the body coordinate frame, and others
 * are relative to the global coordinate frame.
 *
 * Note that the shape of a rigid body is not a dynamical property (except insofar as
 * it influences the various mass properties). It is only collision detection that cares
 * about the detailed shape of the body.

/**
 * @defgroup joints Joints
 *
 * In real life a joint is something like a hinge, that is used to connect two
 * objects.
 * In ODE a joint is very similar: It is a relationship that is enforced between
 * two bodies so that they can only have certain positions and orientations
 * relative to each other.
 * This relationship is called a constraint -- the words joint and
 * constraint are often used interchangeably.
 *
 * A joint has a set of parameters that can be set. These include:
 *
 *
 * \li  dParamLoStop Low stop angle or position. Setting this to
 *	-dInfinity (the default value) turns off the low stop.
 *	For rotational joints, this stop must be greater than -pi to be
 *	effective.
 * \li  dParamHiStop High stop angle or position. Setting this to
 *	dInfinity (the default value) turns off the high stop.
 *	For rotational joints, this stop must be less than pi to be
 *	effective.
 *	If the high stop is less than the low stop then both stops will
 *	be ineffective.
 * \li  dParamVel Desired motor velocity (this will be an angular or
 *	linear velocity).
 * \li  dParamFMax The maximum force or torque that the motor will use to
 *	achieve the desired velocity.
 *	This must always be greater than or equal to zero.
 *	Setting this to zero (the default value) turns off the motor.
 * \li  dParamFudgeFactor The current joint stop/motor implementation has
 *	a small problem:
 *	when the joint is at one stop and the motor is set to move it away
 *	from the stop, too much force may be applied for one time step,
 *	causing a ``jumping'' motion.
 *	This fudge factor is used to scale this excess force.
 *	It should have a value between zero and one (the default value).
 *	If the jumping motion is too visible in a joint, the value can be
 *	reduced.
 *	Making this value too small can prevent the motor from being able to
 *	move the joint away from a stop.
 * \li  dParamBounce The bouncyness of the stops.
 *	This is a restitution parameter in the range 0..1.
 *	0 means the stops are not bouncy at all, 1 means maximum bouncyness.
 * \li  dParamCFM The constraint force mixing (CFM) value used when not
 *	at a stop.
 * \li  dParamStopERP The error reduction parameter (ERP) used by the
 *	stops.
 * \li  dParamStopCFM The constraint force mixing (CFM) value used by the
 *	stops. Together with the ERP value this can be used to get spongy or
 *	soft stops.
 *	Note that this is intended for unpowered joints, it does not really
 *	work as expected when a powered joint reaches its limit.
 * \li  dParamSuspensionERP Suspension error reduction parameter (ERP).
 *	Currently this is only implemented on the hinge-2 joint.
 * \li  dParamSuspensionCFM Suspension constraint force mixing (CFM) value.
 *	Currently this is only implemented on the hinge-2 joint.
 *
 * If a particular parameter is not implemented by a given joint, setting it
 * will have no effect.
 * These parameter names can be optionally followed by a digit (2 or 3)
 * to indicate the second or third set of parameters, e.g. for the second axis
 * in a hinge-2 joint, or the third axis in an AMotor joint.
