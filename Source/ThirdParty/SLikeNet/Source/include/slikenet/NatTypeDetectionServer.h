/// Sends to a remote system on certain ports and addresses to determine what type of router, if any, that client is behind
/// Requires that the server have 4 external IP addresses
/// <OL>
/// <LI>Server has 1 instance of RakNet. Server has four external ip addresses S1 to S4. Five ports are used in total P1 to P5. RakNet is bound to S1P1. Sockets are bound to S1P2, S2P3, S3P4, S4P5
/// <LI>Client with one port using RakNet (C1). Another port not using anything (C2).
/// <LI>C1 connects to S1P1 for normal communication. 
/// <LI>S4P5 sends to C2. If arrived, no NAT. Done. (If didn't arrive, S4P5 potentially banned, do not use again).
/// <LI>S2P3 sends to C1 (Different address, different port, to previously used port on client). If received, Full-cone nat. Done.  (If didn't arrive, S2P3 potentially banned, do not use again).
/// <LI>S1P2 sends to C1 (Same address, different port, to previously used port on client). If received, address-restricted cone nat. Done.
/// <LI>Server via RakNet connection tells C1 to send to to S3P4. If address of C1 as seen by S3P4 is the same as the address of C1 as seen by S1P1 (RakNet connection), then port-restricted cone nat. Done
/// <LI>Else symmetric nat. Done.
