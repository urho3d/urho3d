 * If this flag is not specified the automatic resource tracking algorithm is used.

 * operating systems resources are always released by the thread itself on its exit
 * or on library closure with @c dCloseODE.

 * With manual thread data cleanup mode every collision space object must be 
 * explicitly switched to manual cleanup mode with @c dSpaceSetManualCleanup
 * after creation. See description of the function for more details.
