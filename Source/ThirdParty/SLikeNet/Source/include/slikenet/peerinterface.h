	/// \note Call SetMaximumIncomingConnections if you want to accept incoming connections
	/// \param[in] maxConnections The maximum number of connections between this instance of RakPeer and another instance of RakPeer. Required so the network can preallocate and for thread safety. A pure client would set this to 1.  A pure server would set it to the number of allowed clients.- A hybrid would set it to the sum of both types of connections

	/// \param[in] socketDescriptors An array of SocketDescriptor structures to force RakNet to listen on a particular IP address or port (or both).  Each SocketDescriptor will represent one unique socket.  Do not pass redundant structures.  To listen on a specific port, you can pass SocketDescriptor(myPort,0); such as for a server.  For a client, it is usually OK to just pass SocketDescriptor(); However, on the XBOX be sure to use IPPROTO_VDP
	/// \param[in] socketDescriptorCount The size of the \a socketDescriptors array.  Pass 1 if you are not sure what to pass.
